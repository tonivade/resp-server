# resp-server

Netty implementation of REdis Serialization Protocol, and a simple framework to implement command based protocols.

## Why?

I love REDIS, IMHO is one of the best pieces of code ever made. Is fast, small
and easy. One of the things I love of REDIS is the RESP protocol, and I think that
it would be nice to build a library to implement services using this protocol. I
have to say that this piece of code is based in another project I'm working 
[ClauDB](https://github.com/tonivade/claudb).

## What?

[RESP](http://redis.io/topics/protocol) is the protocol used by REDIS, but it
can be used to implement other client-server protocols.

It's nice because:

- Is easy
- Is fast
- Also is human readable

RESP can serialize some data types

- simple strings: `+PONG\r\n`
- errors: `-ERROR\r\n`
- integers: `:1\r\n`
- bulk strings (binary-safe): `$4\r\nPING\r\n`
- arrays: `*3\r\n:1\r\n:2\r\n:3\r\n`

What binary safe means? It means that can be what ever you want, a UTF-8 String
or compressed data, a picture, etc...

Arrays can hold any data types inside, also other arrays.

And use `\r\n` as delimiter, that means you can open a `telnet/netcat/nc` against
the server port and send whatever you want.

So, what provide this project in addition to the protocol implementation? Well,
it defines a framework to implement command oriented protocols.

You only need to define a set of commands and implement them.

Some commands are built-in, `ping`, `echo`, `time` and `quit`.

## What is a command?

A command is an array of bulk string in RESP, first element in array is the command, 
and the additional elements are the parameters of the command. This is how a command
looks like:

```
    *2\r\n
    $4\r\n
    ECHO\r\n
    $13\r\n
    Hello World!\r\n
```

In this sample, `ECHO` is the command and `Hello world!` is the parameter.

## How is implemented?

The protocol is implemented in Java8, using asynchronous IO ([netty](https://netty.io/)), and using the
reactive programming paradigm ([rxjava](http://www.rxjava.com/)). What that means? It means that is single
thread, every request is managed inside the same thread, so there's no concurrency
issues at all, the same way as REDIS works.

## How can I use it?

It's very easy, you only need 2 lines of code to start the server

```java
    RespServer server = RespServer.builder()
      .host("localhost").port(12345).commands(new CommandSuite()).build();
    server.start();
```

CommandSuite is the default commands suite but you can extend and add your own commands,
well, that's the point :)

What a command looks like?

```java
    @Command("ping")
    public class PingCommand implements RespCommand {
        @Override
        public RedisToken execute(Request request) {
            return RedisToken.status("PONG");
        }
    }
```
    
A command must implement the interface `RespCommand`. This interface only defines
the method `execute`, who receives a `Request` object and returns a `RedisToken`.

You can get the parameter of the command like this

```java
    SafeString param0 = request.getParam(0);
```
    
Every parameter is a `SafeString`, and what the hell is a `SafeString`? Previously,
we said that RESP is binary-safe, so, it means that you can receive anything. `SafeString`
wraps the bytes received, but, don't worry, it's not going to be a problem, trust me.

And you can response to a request this way:

```java
    return RedisToken.status("PONG");
```
    
You have similar methods like `array`, `integer`, `string`, `error`...

Annotations are used to define some metadata to the commands, `@Command` annotation
defines the command name, also there's another annotation, `@ParamLength` to define
the number of the parameter accepted for this command

```java
    @Command("echo")
    @ParamLength(1)
    public class EchoCommand implements RespCommand {
        @Override
        public RedisToken execute(Request request) {
            return RedisToken.string(request.getParam(0));
        }
    }
```
    
If the number of parameters is less than the especified value, the command
is rejected with an error.
